(screen1.png)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

- Thank you for reading our website about a HEALTHY LIFESTYLE.

### Challenge

Users have the ability to:
- Our task is to create a useful one for society.
- 


### When creating the main page, we (index.html ).
- Viewed different site layouts.
- Looked at the cursor hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Created a background shape using code.
- To make the page even more beautiful, we added 3 GIF images
- 2) We added 3 animations
1. Button
2. Icons
3. Template


## To create a website, we used languages such as HTML, CSS and JavaScript.**
The first thing we created in this site was the home page.
We have created a website based on our skills and requirements and criteria.
Our website is about a HEALTHY LIFESTYLE. Why did we take this topic, you ask? Now many people are obese. Since they often eat fast food or fatty foods. 
There are also people who want to tighten their bodies to be in the best shape. 
There are also people who suffer from diabetes or other diseases and therefore they often have to adhere to a certain diet. 
We have created this website for such people to make it easier for them to find the right recipes for a diet.
And if you want to do an exercise, follow certain rules when exercising.

Also, for those who like to read books, we have provided different books about sports or different dietary dishes with recipes. 

Also, if our users want to buy our books or ask about something, we have provided our location map and contact numbers.

## My process

CSS is stored in a separate file. To link to this file from an HTML page, the <link> tag is used between the <head> tags, as shown, which assumes that the style sheet is stored in a file named "style.css". Embedded CSS are styles that are in the header of an HTML document that requires styling. For example, we would like the text in this HTML document to be bold.If there is a lot of JavaScript codeâ€“ it is put in a separate file, which, as a rule, has an extension.js. But even if our code is small, we wanted it to be on another file. To include JavaScript code from an external file in an HTML document, use the src (source) attribute of the <script> tag. Its value should be the URL of the file containing the JS code.


### What I learned

What I learned
In this final work, we learned how to create a professional website where we can make the website we want. 
The content of our site (what we have added to our site).
This 
1) HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT,
2) GRID, FLEXBOX,
3) Fonts, Logo, Social icons, Structure
4) Animated elements in pure HTML/CSS
5) JS Animated, JQUERY
6)Registration form + Login
7) Admin Panel
8) Validation
9) Maps Yandex
10) Local Storage

For example:
Delete class: element.classList.toggle ("classtoremove", false);
Add a class: element.classList.toggle ("classtoadd", true);
The @import rule is used to import one style sheet into another style sheet. This rule also supports media queries so that the user can import a media-dependent stylesheet. The @import rule should be declared at the top of the document after any @charset declaration.
Using an import rule in itself is not a bad practice. You just have to keep in mind that imports are processed only after the file containing them has been uploaded.

``html
Some HTML code that I'm proud of.
 				<a href="index.html">Home</a>
      <a href="contact.html">Contact</a>
      <a href="sport.html">Sports</a>
      <a href="book.html">Books</a>
      <a href="admin registration.html">Admin</a>
      <div class="animation start-home"></div>

```
``css

### Continuous development

We want to keep focusing on developing ideas for future projects. I want to improve and manage
the priority of tasks.But, in our opinion, the main thing is to approach the project consciously and try
to use professional tools and approaches that you have learned about.That is why the constant development and pumping of yourself allows you to be ready for any situations to solve problems. 
But, of course, we understand that the focus of attention can vary depending on our desire and direction. We also want to keep creating lots of creative websites. Thanks for attention.


### Useful resources

- https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp - For some reason, it helped me a lot. I really liked
the templates found there, and I will use them in the future.
- https://developer.mozilla.org/ru/docs/Learn/JavaScript - This is an amazing site that helped me finally
understand. I would recommend this to anyone who is still learning this JavaScript concept.
